# Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
**Folder:** ch-intro-to-qm
**Chapter Title:** Introduction to Quantum Mechanics


## What should readers gain from this new content?
This is a proposal for a potential new chapter which aims to guide beginners in the field of quantum computing and provide them with information regarding the chronological evolution of the field as well the mathematics/physics formalisms and constructs that are necessary to develop a deep understanding of the subject.

The first section here talks about the historical background of quantum mechanics and will give a deeper understanding as to how the idea grew starting from Planck's hypothesis to the famous Stern-Gerlach experiment. The further sections in the chapter, as mentioned in the content table below, show a transition from Classical Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics. This approach helps in bridging the knowledge gap that is currently present in the textbook and also helps one to visualize how quantum mechanics is different (or similar) from classical physics. The chapter focuses on tackling the problem of understanding the much-needed topics discussed in the further chapters of the textbook. This includes chapters related to various quantum operations and even quantum hardware. The aim of this chapter is to give useful content for the readers and provide them with a good foundation for their future learnings.

Potential list of topics (each section below will be a single jupyter notebook, section titles not confirmed):
	1. History of Quantum Physics
		- Planck
		- Photoelectric effect
		- Bohr
		- Stern-Gerlach
	2. Classical formalisms
		- Lagrangian
		- Hamiltonian
		- Poisson's bracket
		- Canonical quantization
	3. Quantum formalisms
		- From classical to quantum
		- Hilbert space
		- Dirac notation
		- Operators in QM
		- Commutators
	4. Time-evolution of quantum systems
		- Schrodinger's picture
		- Heisenberg's picture
		- Dirac's picture
	5. Second-quantization
		- SHM in QM
		- Annihiilation and Creation Operators
		- 2nd Quantization of a Hamiltonian

## Where do you expect this new content to fit in with the current content?
We would like to add a new chapter into the Qiskit Textbook with the title, "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics". The chapter can be placed as an introduction chapter (along with current chapter 1 and 2) or before the point where one starts with the quantum hardware concepts (chapter 5 and 6), as it will aim towards introducing intuitions regarding the mathematics and physics required to tackle the quantum mechanics discussed further in the textbook.

## What material should this new content be based on?
It would be a condensed version and combination of various famous books/texts for Quantum Mechanics. The inspiration would be from the book by Susskind[6], which explains complex concepts in a simple way. We will also try to include the related mathematical concepts for explaining the advanced contents in the later sections (section 4 and 5).

## Are you proposing to write this new content? (y/n)
Yes, we are planning to write this chapter as a new addition to the qiskit textbook. However, we welcome researchers and other subject experts also if they want to contribute to it.
